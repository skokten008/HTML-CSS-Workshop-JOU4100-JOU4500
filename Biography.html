              <h1>Foods you have to try once your in Ottawa!</h1>
           <p>If we could agree on one thing, that would be Ottawa amazing foods. From its fried beavertails to its poutine Ottawans know how to attract people to buy their dish.</p>
              <P>Reuters Institute has conducted a Digital News Report, enlightening the digital news consumptions by conducting a YouGov survey to over 75,000 online news users all-around 38 countries. The topics that caught my attention that the report gave emphasis of was; the effect of populism, the transmission into messaging apps, and the increase in the podcast.

              <p>The report has shown that there was a decrease in the use of social media for news purposes. This would make sense because there are many social media users that we have never heard off. Individuals have access to sharing and posting whatever they are willing to, which makes readers question who the publisher is, are they reliable or whether the is writer bias or not.  People may have good or bad intentions in posting things online, this makes readers doubt the reason for posting articles? News that is posted through social media could lose their credibility and reliability, as many users may think that it lacks journalism ethics.</p>

              <p>Moreover, the report stated that there is an increase in the use of messaging apps for news consumption. I do believe that this is true. In my own experience, I think that using apps like WhatsApp or Line makes it easier to communicate and is more private. However, I find it limits individuals because you can’t follow up every News through messaging apps. Moreover, when I look around, I mostly see people using messaging apps because they have no other way to read News. For instance, if a country is democratic and has freedom of speech, why would individuals use messaging apps? But if an individual’s freedom of speech or any other rights are taken away than individuals would be afraid by their government and would secretly share their thoughts about the News through messaging apps.</p>
