            <h1>About Ottawa</h1>
           
            <p>Ottawa is Canada's beautiful capital. It has a population of more than a million people. Ottawa located in the Ontario region is also close to the Quebec boarder, this is why you'll here people in the streets speaking in English and French. Ottawa is not a crowed city unlike Toronto, and is known as the worlds third cleanest city in the world. </p>
            
            <h2>The Climate</h2>
            <p>Ottawa is famous for having cold winters, but there are times when it has a sunny climate.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>Ottawa experiences all four seasons - Fall, Winter, Spring and summer. Each season gives a different look and feeling towards the city. As the seasons chage there are different kinds of activities that people could do in the city.</p>
              <p>The reason why Ottawa experiences really harsh winters and higher summer temperatures is because unlike other Ontario cities, it does not sit on the shores of the Lake Ontario.</p>
             
            <div class="weather">

            <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The given months of the seasons above are an estimate. So i suggest you to always check the forecaste before coming to Ottawa to get more information. You could  check <a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/ontario/ottawa" target="_blank">The Weather Network</a> just to be prepared. </p>
                 
            <p> The northern parts of the province have harsher winters compared with the southern Ontario. </p>
             
            <p><b>Is Ottawa located in an earthquakes zone?</b></p>
            <p>yes it is, especially the Ottawa River is an earthquake sub-zone.</p>
            <p>The last significant earthquake seen was in 2015 with a magnitude of 5.0 shake, that was felt in the North East of Ottawa. however, damaging quakes are so rare in the area.</p>     
              <h4>Quality of Life in Ottawa</h4>
              <p><b>Ottawans care about their lifestyles.</b></p>
              <p>The capital city is known for  being reserved, quiet, family-friendly and a place where people concentarte on sports rather than nightlife. in other words, i like to call ottawa a student-friendly enviroment, where students could concentrate more on their studies instead of spending their time on useless things</p>
              
              <p>One of the Canadian Magazine <a href="https://www.moneysense.ca/spend/real-estate/canadas-best-places-to-live-2012/" target="_blank">Moneysense</a> scores Ottawa the best city in Canada. The Magazine rated Ottawa as the best place to raise kids, best job opportunities, and best place to retire. Ottawa is also in the first place in the high number of doctors, low crime rates, the growth in population and culture. </p>
