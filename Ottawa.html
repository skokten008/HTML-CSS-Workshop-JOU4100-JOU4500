              I learnt that first a difference should be made when it came to “truth” and “news”. The author states that not every news that’s been made is actually true, since not every event that’s happing have an eyewitness, how can they be true than right? The facts could be told by one person to another, but I don’t believe the context would.
              <p>
              However, the authors state that, that’s what journalists do, they often go to the event and try to interview people that have witness the event. They have to get all the information possible from the people around the event or risk the accuracy of the news.</p>

              <p>  Firstly, the corporation should be dedicated to its citizens. Journalists are more capable of working well when both sides of the corporation, are determined in sticking with giving its citizen with honest and independent news. I understood that if cooperation is divided as an ideology on providing accurate news, then there might be serious problems. Also, this all depends on the owner of the corporation and how she/he runs it. If the owner profoundly believes in journalistic ethics and values, then I think that journalists would work well.</p>
              <p>
              Secondly, hiring managers that are committed to their citizen first. Hiring managers that are sticking to core values of journalism, to run the business is one of the crucial factors that the owner has to determine. Moreover, the final decision is for the journalist to make. It is their (journalist) mission in protecting the truthfulness of the news, as well as the commercial brand.

              Furthermore, the other point that was made was to always rely on your original way of reporting. In my opinion, everyone has their own style of doing things the same could be said while reporting. I believe that every journalist should be transparent about their techniques and motives while reporting, as that’s the way of genuinely evolving in becoming one.
